Distributed Computing
================================

Distributed Computing is the same concept as parallel computing.  However, the
processors reside on different physical computers/servers.  Which allows each
processor to have it's own memory bank.  Distributing your problem over several
servers divides memory usage, and is how we deal with large memory use
applications.
