National Computing Infrastructure Resources
============================================

`XSEDE <www.xsede.org>`_ is an organization that has access to a number of
different computing resources for the STEM discipline.  Almost all of them are
free to use for researchers.  Depending on the resource, you might need to
write a small proposal outlining the reason for the need; for which
allocations are granted.  Other resources give researchers some set of CPU
hours, and if you need a higher number you will need to write a proposal.

Additionally, they offer free online training through webcasts that will train
researchers on a bulk of topics, including parallel computing and how to submit
proposals.
